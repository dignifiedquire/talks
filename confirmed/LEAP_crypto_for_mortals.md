# LEAP Encryption Access Project: Encrypted Communications for Mere Mortals

What if I told you that a regular user can get gpg-encrypted communications
just following a wizard and click-click-click? What if I told you that
her email can be backuped in the cloud, in a way that a server compromise could
not reveal the private data? What about an Encrypted Proxy that's at the same
reasonably secure and easy to use, configure and deloy? 

Well, you don't have to trust me. Just come and see it with your own eyes.

At LEAP we are obsessed with making possible for any service provider to easily
deploy secure services and for people to use these services without needing to
learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open,
federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the
user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible. 

On the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set
of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of
entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have
created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically
configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to
enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect
to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.
