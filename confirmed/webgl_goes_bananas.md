# WebGL goes Bananas

We will learn how to create this animation (_using only mathematics_)

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joates/talks/wegl-gone-bananas-img/img/glsl-demo.gif)

Roadmap

* I'll be using a [Banana Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Pi) single-board computer which can be purchased for about €60 [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.fr/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_9/280-4488909-0265640?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&url=search-alias%3Dcomputers&field-keywords=banana%20pi&sprefix=banana+pi%2Caps%2C223)

* Nobody needs to buy a Banana Pi, i'm just using it because my laptop was recently stolen :(

* This will also work on any other device that [supports WebGL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL#Support) which means all modern GPUs (the single exeption is Apple's iOS, although this may change with the release of iOS 8).

* I estimate this will be approx. 30 mins of presentation time.

* Presentation will be delivered in English and probably include quite a bit of swearing (although i *can* also swear in French if you prefer ;-)
