# Secession from the broadcast

It's time to travel to the edges because this is where the interesting stuff
happens.  "What is popular" is rarely a question that helps finding edges.
I'd like to recap what i learned in 15 months of my re-juvenated and
re-energized quest into decentralization and what it might mean.  

For one, I'd like to forward a question from Gene Youngblood's
[Secession from the broadcast lecture][1]: "how can we create on the
same scale as we can destroy?".  Gene suggests we need to move away from
the "audience nation" by becoming "political actors" instead of
"interested spectators of action".

Second, I paraphrase a thought from Adam Ierymenko's [I want to
believe][2]: If full decentralization is technically too hard currently,
can we construct and make use of a "Blind Idiot God" (BIG) instance
which co-ordinates some communication but can not abuse it or even
understand what's going on precisely?  

Lastly, I wonder how can we create sustained systems and services if we
don't want the centralized web service cash cow control model?
As Laura Kolbag [3] pointed out recently in Nuernberg, paying
for software might not be so bad if the "free to use" models 
mean surveillance and centralized control. And she notes
that design and useability should drive open source developments
instead of features and options.

The edges are where we encounter the others, those who are somehow unlike.
It's a place where i easily run into fears and look for friends.  At the edges
there is no central authority suggesting what to think or do next.  And
the number of people at the edges is always lower than in the center.
But that's fine, this is how things get moving as i've experienced
myself a number of times now.
