# Objective

How ES{6,7,8..} will change the way you code JS, both on client and server side?!

# Description

JavaScript.next('ES6') is here!

Time has arrived to use the reserved keywords like class and module, along with iterators, for/of loops, Python-style generators and generator expressions, arrow functions, binary data, collections (maps, sets and weak maps), proxies (metaprogramming for virtual objects and wrappers) and much more!

Given that ES6 is very vast, in this talk I shall be giving an overview of all the above mentioned major features with demo on how we can use them today!
