# Secession from the broadcast

It's time to travel to the edges because this is where the interesting stuff
happens.  "What is popular" is rarely a question that helps finding edges.
In this talk round i'll recap what i learned in 15 months of my
re-juvenated and re-energized quest into decentralization and what it
means.  

For one, I'd like to present a question from Gene Youngblood's
"Secession from the broadcast" lecture [1]: "how can we create on the
same scale as we can destroy?".  Gene suggests we need to move away from
the "Audience nation" by becoming "political actors" instead of
"interested spectators of action".  

Second, I highlight a thought from Adam Ierymenko [2]:  If full
decentralization is technically too hard currently, can we construct and
make use of a **Blind Idiot God** (BIG) instance which co-ordinates some
communication but can not abuse it or even understand what's going on
precisely?  

Lastly, how can we create sustained systems and products if we
don't want to imitate the centralized web service cash cow model?
As Laura Kolbag [3] pointed out recently in Nuernberg, paying
for software might not be so bad if the "free to use" models 
mean surveillance and centralized control. And she suggests
that design and useability should drive Open Source software 
instead of features and options.

The edges are where we encounter the others, those who are somehow 
not like us.  It's a place where i easily run into fears.  At the edges
there is no central authority suggesting what to think or do next.  The
number of people at the edges is by definition lower than in the center.
But it's where things can happen.  Secession from the broadcast.
