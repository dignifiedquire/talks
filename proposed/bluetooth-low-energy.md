# Using Bluetooth Low Energy for Good

When you hear Bluetooth, you probably think of annoying consumer tech like awkward hands-free phone guy, wow so fitness: you-took-1,337-steps-today trackers, and stalking customers with ads in retail stores.

But, I propose that Bluetooth LE can be used for good, and has many potential useful and interesting applications. In particular, it can be used to interface with distributed systems in meatspace and facilitate more secure cryptographic transactions.

I plan to cover the basic high-level concepts of Bluetooth LE such as scanning and advertising, services, characteristics, and peripheral and central networking, including code examples using the `noble`/`bleno` nodejs modules and briefly touch on the firmware and hardware side of low cost, low power bluetooth radios.
