# Transmission

Would love to give an introduction to UDT.
A protocol I have been spending a some time on.

It is baked into some well known open source P2P frameworks and has other utility.

Expect: 

* Sidebars on protocol implementation/general development nightmares
* War stories on other P2P/data transfer problems I have worked on IRL
* Live Demo


Do Not Expect 

* Packet Frame Diagrams
* Mathamatical Proofs

Love as always
