# The intranet of things


Now is the time for the internet of things, they say, a bit like the rise of the internet itself, we are "discovering" a new free land, full of creativity, freedom and beautiful ideas.

It is also a time where we know how much value our government value our privacy, a moment where insurance company buy your biometric data for a couple of euro a month ... 

History repeat itself, but the cycles are faster and faster every time, we know that we have to fight right now for a free internet, and still we let Trojans in our home everyday. 

What we call now internet of things is basically gathering sensors data, send them over the internet to _"the cloud"_ treat/store that data and eventually send data back.

Why don't we take our data back home and treat it where it belongs ?

The privacy we are all betting here is more dangerous than most of our browsing history/personals emails

So we should we build our own system to enjoy the possibilities of all the things without giving sensitive data about our lives. 

but can't we play also their own game ? some of them offer them to [pay less insurance by selling your biometric data](https://www.discovery.co.za/portal/individual/vitality-how-to-earn) some of them talk about [Building database of biometric data to build per case dependance insurance policies](http://www.scor.com/images/stories/pdf/library/scor-inform/scorinf_construction%20bases%20bio_fr_bd_pg.pdf), can't we all be athletes in the world of things ? 

All of these questions have no clear responses, and I believe we should talk about it.
